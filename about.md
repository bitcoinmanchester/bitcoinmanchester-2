## History

Bitcoin Manchester was founded by [Max Flores][maxsan] and [Ash Moran][ashmoran] who met at the Bitcoin Conference London 2012. Nine months later they met again by accident in Manchester. They had both been independently thinking that Manchester needed a meeting point for Bitcoin enthusiasts, and so Bitcoin Mancester was formed.

## About the website

Up until March 2016, we ran off a forked version of the [Sheffield Ruby User Group][shrug] site. Thanks are due to James Almond for use of the design.

Around the end of 2015, Max visited Hong Kong and met Leonhard Weese and other members of the Bitcoin Association Hong Kong, and we are now using a forked version of the [Bitcoin HK][bitcoinhk] site. Thanks guys!
