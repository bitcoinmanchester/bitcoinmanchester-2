Interested in Bitcoin / digital currency mining? Take one of our workshops to help you understand the basics and get to grips with the technical know-how.

Meet like minded people, talk with experienced miners and lets help you get started.

This workshop will follow-on from our previous workshop : "How does Bitcoin Mining work?".

This is part 2 of 2 event.

As always if you want to just come and spectate, please do. All are welcome.

## Pizza & Pub

As always we'll have sponsored pizza at the event. We will order from [Just-Eat][just-eat] and pay with a Bitcoin debit card.

Finally at around 9pm we'll head to the pub, which is our new friend [Terrace][terrace] right next to MadLab.
