This month we have Adam B Levine (famous for [Let's Talk Bitcoin][letstalkbitcoin]) speaking about [Tokenly][tokenly], the business he has co-founded and where he serves as CEO. He will be on a video feed from the USA, where he lives and works.

## Tokenly

Tokenly is a set of services that run on the Bitcoin blockchain. They include a wallet, a payment processor, an access control service, and numerous others both already available and in the pipeline.

Adam will introduce the idea of tokens, explain redeemables and access tokens, and then do a Q&A to cover topics the audience is interested to hear more about.

## Pizza & Pub

As always we'll have sponsored pizza provided by one of the Bitcoin-accepting [Takeaway.com][takeaway] vendors.

Finally at around 9pm we'll head to the pub, which is our new friend [Terrace][terrace] right next to MadLab.

## Additional note

It would be apprecited if people this time do RSVP via our [Meetup Page][meetup] for numbers as we have limited space due to which room we are in this round.
