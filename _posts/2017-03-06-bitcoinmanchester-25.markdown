Lightning Network - Lightning Talks

This month we will be discussing the new layer 2 technology Lightning Network. The idea behind this month is to have multiple people produce short 2-3 minute suggestions on what concepts could be created.

We will start the night with a high level overview of the system and how it works for those who know nothing of the system and want to just learn about it.

Lightning may just be the answer that everyone was originally looking for with micro transcations, ultra cheap and massively scalable. Lets hear those ideas!

Highly encouraged that the audiance coming may want to produce a single image or a concept to pitch to the group. It is not a requirement but the more the better.

If you are unfamiliar with lightning information can be found in the following places.

## Pizza & Pub

As always we'll have sponsored pizza at the event. We will order from [Just-Eat][just-eat] and pay with a Bitcoin debit card.

Finally at around 9pm we'll head to the pub, which is our new friend [Terrace][terrace] right next to MadLab.
