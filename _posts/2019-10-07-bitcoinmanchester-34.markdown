Our first crypto meetup at our Tre Amici Pizzeria. The meetup is free to attend and will offer FREE pizza!

Our event will host: SidewalkBitcoin (https://twitter.com/SidewalkBitcoin) who will be demoing the awesome FastBitcoins Lightning Terminal. (Which we currently use in the Pizzeria) and a workshop from the awesome Greg Walker (https://twitter.com/in3rsha) - Hosting "How Blockchain Works"

If you would like a play with the FastBitcoins Lightning Terminal ensure you have a Lightning wallet installed!

Possible additional topics we may discuss: Updates regarding CoinFestUK 2020, Our CryptoGrabber Arcade project and the lastest goings-on in the Crypto space!

As this is our first meetup at the Pizzeria we are not sure how the set-up will go so it will be a work in progress as things happen. Feel free to drop in and have chat.

Drinks available for purchase (Yes you can pay in BTC!)
