This month a specification will be  presented on a new concept project which will be layered on top of the Lightning Network. There is an open call all who want to get involved or contribute in some way to the concept.

The presentation itself will have both technical and non technical concepts which the information should be accessible to all. 

## Pizza & Pub

As always at around 9pm we'll head to the pub which includes pizza, which is our new friend [Terrace][terrace] right next to MadLab.
