Weâ€™re going to have a casual get together and discuss what we can do in 2014 - session topics, how to engage more people, promote the group etc.After that we'll head to the pub.

We'll have sponsored food as usual, in case you didn't eat enough over Christmas / New Year. [Takeaway.com][takeaway] now accepts payment in bitcoins in the UK, and it definitely works, so there will be more Bitcoin pizza!

We're [at the MadLab][madlab-event] again.
