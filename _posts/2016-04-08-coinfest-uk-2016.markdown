CoinFest UK is being organised by [CryptoBates Group][cryptobates]. We’re helping out with a few  things, but all the credit for organising goes to CryptoBates. CryptoBates run a number of projects, including [Crypto Cloud Hosting][cryptocloudhosting], and accept possibly the longest list of cryptocurrencies of any hosting provider, including, of course, Bitcoin.
