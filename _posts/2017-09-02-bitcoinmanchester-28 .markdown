Interested in Bitcoin / digital currency mining? Take one of our workshops to help you understand the basics and get to grips with the technical know-how.

Meet like minded people, talk with experienced miners and lets help you get started.

This is a replay and improvement on our first workshop, now that segwit is activated in the main chain, come along and learn about these new improvments and how they work along with why they are important for the future of the network. Greg will revise content from before and explain how segwit works on both the miner and user level on how segwit blocks are created and how the benefits to users by using these new transaction types.

As always if you want to just come and spectate, please do. All are welcome.

## Pizza & Pub

As always we'll have sponsored pizza at the event. We will order from [Just-Eat][just-eat] and pay with a Bitcoin debit card.

Finally at around 9pm we'll head to the pub, which is our new friend [Terrace][terrace] right next to MadLab.
